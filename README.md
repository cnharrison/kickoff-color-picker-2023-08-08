Hi folks! Loved this excercise. 

### Phase 1 -- Picker

Build a simple web based color picker. The picker should:

1. Take input for RGB values ✅
2. Display the current color ✅

### Phase 2 -- Palettes

Build a form to create a palette of 5 colors. ✅

### Phase 3 -- Persistence

Persist palettes to the database.

1. Add ability to save multiple palettes ✅
2. Don't worry about palette owners. They're global.✅
3. Display all the persisted palettes in the UI. ✅
4. Enable deleting of palettes. ❌
5. Enable editing of palettes. ✅

Didn't have time to enable deleting unfortunately, although its pretty trivial/straightforward. Sacrificed that on the altar of time becaused it seemed like the less fun/most useless feature 😄
